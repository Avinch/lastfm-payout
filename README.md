## Last.fm Payout

Small tool using the [Last.fm Web API](https://www.last.fm/api) to estimate how much you have paid to artists through streaming platforms.

Results are an estimate using average payout figures from streaming services i.e. Spotify, so will not be entirely accurate but would still show the scale of how little is actually being given out.
